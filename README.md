# AI Object Detection Project

This project demonstrates real-time object detection using a webcam feed, powered by [ml5.js](https://ml5js.org/), a high-level interface for TensorFlow.js. The project is designed with a simple user interface and is built using HTML, CSS (Materialize CSS framework), and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Real-time Object Detection**: Detects objects in the webcam feed using the COCO-SSD model.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Materialize CSS for a clean and responsive UI.
- **Customizable Settings**: Includes options to enable/disable the AI, adjust frame rate (FPS), and view detected objects on a canvas overlay.
